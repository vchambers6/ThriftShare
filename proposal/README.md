# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

ThriftShare

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows harvard students to give away and claim used/unwanted items for free.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will be a online trading platform via which users can put up items for others to claim. Users would be given a monthly or weekly allowance of a website currency. Users would be required to rate the product that they claimed and the overall interaction with the other user. To gain more of this currency, users will receive extra currency for each item that they give away on the platform dependent on the rating that the receiving user gave.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to establish a site that has a login feature and a trade feature; it might not be aesthetically pleasing or a secure website.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functional website with CSS elements and is more secure in that it only allows people with harvard emails to sign up.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a website that is stylistically pleasing, fully functional as we imagined it, and contains security features that prohibits malicious actors from accessing userâ€™s information and abusing the features of the site (like claiming more than the allotted amount of items).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?


We will write a pseudocode skeleton for the website. We will have to refine our skills in javascript. Vanessa will do any javascript work, and Juan will do any SQL. Otherwise, we will most likely divide labor between defined functions in python and templates in HTML.
We also need to do more research on how to increase the security of a website.
