#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have created an outline for our entire project, and we have started implementing some of the app routes including register, login, and post

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not researched security measures, and also how to solve the problems listed below. Also I have not implemented a lot of the app routes,
including one of the most important ones "buy"

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Vanessa and I are trying to figure how a user can upload an image in a form, and how to display that image on our webpage.
Also if a require an email for the registration process, how do I make registration automaticlly shoot a verification email to the user,
which requires the user to verify the account before it can be used.
